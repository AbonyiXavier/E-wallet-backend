## About

This Project, Mentel, is part of the #BuidForSDG challenge, created by Team-017. 

## Why

The Team decided to take on the problem of helping to find innovative ways that can link mental health specialists to your community, which is SDG Goal 3, Problem 1.

We believe mental health is not taken as serious as it should, and the stigma associated with identifying as having a form of mental challenge has made it more difficult for people to seek the help they require.

With this app, we aim to link mental health specialists to our communities while offering a convenient, confidential and cost effective approach.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
